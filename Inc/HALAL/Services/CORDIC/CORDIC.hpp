/**
 * @brief Cordic class. Has some trigonometric static functions with high speed computation time
 *
 * The cordic class calculates with integers cosine, sine, phase and modulus twice as fast as arm_q31 functions do
 * The class uses its own units (as arm_q31 methods do) to traduce angles, coordinates, and results to have the maximun precision
 * Angles go in the range of [-pi, pi] -> [-max int32, max int32] radians for ints and [0,2*pi] -> [0, max uint32] for uints. They are equivalent
 * Coordinates go in the range of [-1,1] -> [-max int32, max int32] for ints (they work on uints but not in a logical way).
 * If we wanted to represent any euclidean space we would need to delimit and scale it.
 * Precision of these functions are all around 5*10^-10
 * The methods just check if the cordic is correctly configurated, configurate it if thats not the case, then writes inside the CORDIC and reads the results
 * They work with vectors so you can ask for multiple values so it skips the small overhead after the first.
 *
 *
 * The CORDIC configuration work as follows
 * In the CSR CORDIC register you can directly configurate the CORDIC by writting on it.
 * The masks for each variable that you can configurate are:
 * Functions : 0x0000000F (0.COSINE 1.SINE 2.PHASE 3.MODULUS 4.ARCTANGENT 5.HCOSINE 6.HSINE 7.HARCTANGENT 8.NATLOG 9.SQRT)
 * Precision : 0x000000F0 (0.1_cycle 1.2_cycles 2.3_cycles ...) (we use on all of them 6, the maximum for the CORDIC inside the stm (can configurate more but does nothing))
 * Scale : 0x00000700 (0 = 0, 1 = 1 ... means that the in has been shifted to the right and the output needs to be shifted to the left) (we do not use this, 0)
 * Interrupt enabled : 0x00010000 (0.disabled 1.enabled) (only useful for DMA, which we do not use)
 * DMA read and write : 0x00020000 0x00040000 (respectively) (same as abode)
 * In and out arguments: 0x00100000 0x00080000 (respectively) (0.1argument 1.2arguments) (depends on the function and if we want residual results)
 * Width input and output: 0x00200000 0x00400000 (respectively) (0.32bytes 1.16bytes) (we use max size for more precision, 0)
 * Ready flag : 0x80000000 (this is to check if the CORDIC is ready, but the bus already handles all the transactions on the CORDIC inside the stm so we don t need to waste processing time on this)

	 *
	 * Uses a cosine query but configurating the CORDIC to save the residual results
	 * The residual results are values that appear when calculating any function, which are not the return of the function itself
	 * The cosine function of the CORDIC gives as residual result the sine function, so if you read twice you will get first cosine then sine
	 * If you don t configurate the CORDIC to save its residual result it will not work. The method does it by itself, thats why we don t just use the cosine method.
	 * The exact time it takes is around 4 cycles more than the cos function, which is around 30-40. So 10% more as it needs to read one more register.
	 * The reads are protected to give the correct result, thats why it needs 4 cycles for the read (on average) and not just one
