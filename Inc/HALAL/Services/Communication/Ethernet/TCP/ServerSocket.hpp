/**
* @brief class that handles a single point to point server client connection, emulating the server side.
*
* The flow of this class goes as follows:
*
* 1. When the constructor is called, the listener is activated and starts working immediately
*
* 2. After a client issues a connection to the ServerSocket and Ethernet#update is executed, the ServerSocket accepts the request
*
* 3. Accepting the request raises an interrupt that calls accept_callback, which closes the listener socket (on server_control_block) and opens the connection socket (on client_control_block)
*
* 4. The connection goes on until one of the ends closes it, which calls the ErrorHandler to send the board into fault as a default behaviour.
*
* @see Ethernet#update
