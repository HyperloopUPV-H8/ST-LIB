  - Follow the installation instructions.

- Clone the repository:
  - Open a terminal (command prompt or command line).
  - Navigate to the desired directory where you want to download the repository.
  - Run the cloning command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/HyperloopUPV-H8/ST-LIB.git
    ```
  - The repository will be cloned into a new directory named `ST-LIB`.

**Downloading a ZIP File:**

- Navigate to the GitHub repository page:
  - Visit the [ST-LIB repository page](https://github.com/HyperloopUPV-H8/ST-LIB).

- Download the ZIP file:
  - Click the green “Code” button above the file list.
  - Select "Download ZIP" from the dropdown menu.
  - The ZIP file will download to your computer.

- Extract the ZIP file:
  - Find the downloaded ZIP file (usually in your Downloads folder).
  - Use your preferred file compression software to extract the files.
  - After extracting, access the `ST-LIB` folder to find all the contents.

**Note:** Cloning with Git offers version control features that are not available when you download the repository as a ZIP file. If you plan to contribute or keep your copy updated, cloning via Git is advised.
